    <b><h3>Critical Infrastructure Security</h3></b>

    <p>
        <b>Critical infrastructure protection (CIP)</b> is a concept that relates to the preparedness and response to serious incidents that involve the critical infrastructure of a region or nation.
        <br>
        The American Presidential directive PDD-63 of May 1998 set up a national program of "Critical Infrastructure Protection".In 2014 the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was published after further presidential directives.
        <br>
        In Europe, the equivalent European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) refers to the doctrine or specific programs created as a result of the European Commission's directive EU COM(2006) 786 which designates European critical infrastructure that, in case of fault, incident, or attack, could impact both the country where it is hosted and at least one other European Member State. Member states are obliged to adopt the 2006 directive into their national statutes.

         <b><h3>History</h3></b>
         <hr size="2" width="95%" color="grey">

         <p>
            The U.S. CIP is a national program to ensure the security of vulnerable and interconnected infrastructures of the United States. In May 1998, President Bill Clinton issued presidential directive PDD-63 on the subject of critical infrastructure protection.[1] This recognized certain parts of the national infrastructure as critical to the national and economic security of the United States and the well-being of its citizenry, and required steps to be taken to protect it.
            <br>
            This was updated on December 17, 2003, by President Bush through Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-7 for <b> Critical Infrastructure Identification, Prioritization, and Protection.</b>The directive describes the United States as having some critical infrastructure that is "so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety."
